This directory is used for building OpenDX with Visual Studio. There
are a few requirements that must be met.

1) Many source files must be created on a UN*X system before trying 
   to compile or even open the Visual Studio project. These files
   are created with awk scripts and Bison. Included in this directory
   is a UN*X script that can be run on the src tree to create these
   files (unix-build-sources).

2) The libraries are being built as dll's only. If you require static
   libs, you will have to do the work yourself. Good luck.

3) A valid dxconfig.h script is included, but may need editted if you
   don't have things like ImageMagick installed and ready to link to.
