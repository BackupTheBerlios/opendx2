Open Visualization Data Explorer

    This is a *very* early version of the OpenDX source distribution.
Your patience is appreciated!  It is quite likely that problems will 
arise building OpenDX; if you encounter difficulties, please try to
work them through as best you can.  If you find solutions, please send 
in a note;  they'll be incorporated into the distribution as time allows,
and it'll be that much easier for the next person.  If you find a
problem that you can't solve, again, send a note;  we'll try to help.

For the moment, please mail installation problems to the bug-report
address listed on the website where you downloaded OpenDX.

Bugs:

    While DX 4.0 has a very mature code base, many source files (actually
virtually all, thanks to the new copyright notice) have been modified for 
this first open source release.  Furthermore, its likely that it is being
built on previously unencountered OS versions and using different compilers 
than before; as such, bugs may arise.  As above, take a crack at it if you
wish, then send reports in to the bug-report address.

Version:

    This version, labelled 4.0, is an upgrade from the final IBM
distribution, DX 3.1.4.  It corresponds to the final bug-fix version of
of 3.1.4 plus several new features amongst which are  improved OpenGL
rendering (better use of display lists, most notably), JavaDX, and
stereo rendering.  

Build Instructions:
  
    BEFORE YOU CONFIGURE IT... set the SHELL environment variable to sh

    This is intended to be a simple configure-and-make build.

    	configure
	make
	make install (as root)

    By default, the installation will be in /usr/local/dx; this can be
changed using the --prefix= argument to configure:

	configure --prefix=/usr/lpp
	make
	make install (as root)

will install place the installation in /usr/lpp/dx

Prerequisites:

    Motif  	- Lesstif works, www.gnu.org
    OpenGL 	- Mesa3D works,  www.mesa3D.org

    For Windows builds:
	Cygwin  - www.cygnus.com 
	not sure what, if anything, else

    Not required, but nice:

    NetCDF	- www.unidata.ucar.edu
    CDF		- nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cdf

Hints:

    If you are using Lesstif instead of Motif, you may need to create
symbolic links in /usr/include to /usr/X11R6/include/Xm and /usr/X11R/X11.

    If you are using Mesa3G instead of OpenGL, you will need symbolic links
/usr/local/lib/libGL.a pointing to /usr/local/lib/libMesaGL.a and
/usr/local/lib/libGLu.a pointing to /usr/local/lib/libMesaGLu.a

    If you are building on Windows, things are really untested.  Best of
luck, and let us know how it goes.

Known Problems:

    Run-time Loading - eg. user-defined modules, interactors

    Java DX - The code is all there; however, it has not been tried under
    this distribution.  

    Probably lots of other things.
