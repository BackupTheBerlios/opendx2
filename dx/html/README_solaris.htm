======================================================================== 
  
  
1. System Configuration  
  
A. Default Keyboard Mappings 
On the Sun SPARCstations, Ctrl+Delete is Ctrl+Del.  "Del" is found 
on the numeric keypad.  Data Explorer responds to the "End" key and arrow 
keys found on the numeric keypad.  The mnemonic key to pull down the menus 
uses the diamond key as the modifier, instead of the Alt key. 
  
B. Memory Usage 
Under Solaris, Data Explorer uses shared memory in 256 megabyte segments. 
The default configuration for Solaris only allows 1 megabyte shared memory 
segments.  To allow Data Explorer to run, log in as root, and follow these 
steps: 
  
    1)  Copy /etc/system to /etc/system.pre-dx 
    2)  edit /etc/system 
    3)  add the line "set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax = 0x10000000" 
    4)  reboot the system 
If this cannot be done, see the DXSHMEMSEGMAX environment variable, described 
in Appendix C of the User Guide.  
  
C. Error message "cannot get shared memory segment" 
This error message is caused by one of two problems: 
    1)  The system hasn't been configured for 256 megabyte shared memory 
        segments.  Follow the rules above under Memory Usage. 
    2)  There is insufficient swap space available on the workstation. 
        Type "swap -l" to determine available space.  You must either 
        increase swap space or run Data Explorer with the -memory option 
        to reduce its use of memory.  For example, type "dx -memory 32" to 
        restrict Data Explorer to 32 megabytes of memory. 
  
  
2. Hardware Rendering Considerations 
  
A. Shared Library Support for Hardware Rendering 
When hardware rendering is requested for the first time, the executive 
dynamically loads /usr/lpp/dx/bin_solaris/DXhwdd.so and the xgl shared 
libraries.  If one of these is not present then hardware rendering will 
be disabled. 
  
B. Hardware Rendering Not Available Message 
When the message 'Hardware rendering not available: /usr/lib/libxgl.so not 
found' appears, then xgl shared library or run-time support has not been 
installed. 
  
C. Transparency 
Transparency is not handled by the Sun Hardware Renderer. 
  
D. Lines are redrawn in black 
When using direct interactors which draw lines on the image (e.g. zoom 
box), the lines will be redrawn in black.  They will persist until 
the image is redrawn. 
  
  
3. On Line Help Path Menu 
In the current implementation of Data Explorer, the pop-up menu 
providing the current help path is not supported. 
  
4. Runtime-loadable modules  
You need to use -mdf flag on dx to load runtime modules from the 
command line if you are using more than 1 processor. That is, 
you cannot use the "Load Module Description" option of the File menu 
to load them after Data Explorer has started.
