<P><STRONG>Functional Details</STRONG>
<P>
This module traces the path of a particle through a changing vector
field in discrete steps.
The visual form of this trace is a streakline, which starts at a
specified time and continues until the particle it represents
exits from the field or until the field "expires."
<TABLE CELLPADDING="3">
<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>name</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>is required only if more than one invocation of Streakline in
the
same visual program uses the same
<TT><STRONG>start</STRONG></TT>,
<TT><STRONG>time</STRONG></TT>,
<TT><STRONG>head</STRONG></TT>,
<TT><STRONG>curl</STRONG></TT>, and
<TT><STRONG>flag</STRONG></TT> arguments with different vector fields
(<TT><STRONG>data</STRONG></TT>).
<P>
The reason for this requirement is that, in order to function
efficiently in movie applications,
Streakline saves intermediate results from frame to frame.
This information is stored internally in association with a key.
Each invocation of the Streakline module in the same graph receives a
unique name, which is constructed from the
<TT><STRONG>name</STRONG></TT>,
<TT><STRONG>start</STRONG></TT>,
<TT><STRONG>time</STRONG></TT>,
<TT><STRONG>head</STRONG></TT>,
<TT><STRONG>curl</STRONG></TT>, and
<TT><STRONG>flag</STRONG></TT> arguments.
Thus, if more than one invocation of Streakline in the same graph uses
the same arguments, varying only the vector field, a unique
<TT><STRONG>name</STRONG></TT> string must be assigned to each.
<P>
If you have only one Streakline module or if any of the inputs to the
module other than <TT><STRONG>data</STRONG></TT> are different between
the two modules, you do not need to specify
<TT><STRONG>name</STRONG></TT>.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>data</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>specifies a vector field or vector field series.
Vector fields are limited to <I>n</I>-D vectors defined in
<I>n</I> space; for example, 2-D vectors on a 2-D sheet or
3-D vectors defined in a 3-D volume.
<P>
The individual time-step vector fields are passed to Streakline as
<TT><STRONG>data</STRONG></TT>, either combined in a single series
object or one at a time in successive executions of the
graph containing the Streakline module, as fields.
Times are associated with each vector field by the "series position"
attached to each member of the series group.
Vector values in between these times are interpolated linearly from the
prior and subsequent vector fields.
The times associated with each field should increase monotonically as
they are encountered by the Streakline module, either as the
individual series members are indexed or as the
individual series members are encountered in
successive executions of the graph.
Vector fields encountered out of order are ignored.
<P>
If <TT><STRONG>data</STRONG></TT> is a single field rather than a series
group, then it must have a "series position" attribute for
Streakline to accept it.
This attribute is attached when a series member is selected with the
Select module.
The individual members of the series group can be extracted using the
Select module or by requesting a single member of the series when
using the Import module.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>start</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>specifies a set of points at which streaklines originate.
It can be either a list of positions or a geometric field (e.g., the
output of a Grid module).
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>time</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>specifies a set of times at which streaklines begin to be
traced.
The units of time correspond to the units of the vector field.
That is, a particle travelling at a unit velocity moves one unit of
distance in one unit of time.
<P>
Both <TT><STRONG>time</STRONG></TT> and <TT><STRONG>start</STRONG></TT> can
contain
single or multiple elements.
If either parameter contains a single element, that element is
associated with each element of the other list.
If both parameters contain multiple elements, they must contain the
same number of elements, which are then matched in pairs.
This allows either a single starting point to be associated with several
different starting times, several starting points to be associated
with a single starting time, or several starting points to be
associated with individual starting times.
If no <TT><STRONG>time</STRONG></TT> parameter is given, the series position
of the first member of the vector field series (either the first
series member or the first individual vector field encountered)
is used.
If no <TT><STRONG>start</STRONG></TT> parameter is given, the center point of
the first member of the vector field series is used.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>head</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>specifies an expiration time for streaklines that have not
otherwise terminated.
The streakline points are computed iteratively, and the spacing between
the points depends on the element size of the connections.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>frame</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>allows the Streakline module to incrementally generate
streaklines
when the entire series is input as <TT><STRONG>data</STRONG></TT>.
For example, you could attach the Sequencer to <TT><STRONG>frame</STRONG></TT>,
and as <TT><STRONG>frame</STRONG></TT> advanced, the streaklines
would grow longer.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>flag</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>specifies whether the normals of the streaklines produced rotate
according to the vorticity of the vector field or do not rotate
at all.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>curl</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>specifies the curl of the vector field (see
<A HREF="refgu049.htm#HDRDIVCURL">DivCurl</A>).
<P>
If the vorticity of the vector field is supplied by this parameter,
the curl is interpolated from it.
In that case, the field must correspond to the vector field in type
(either both must be a series or both must be a single field)
and they should correspond in time.
If <TT><STRONG>curl</STRONG></TT> is specified, the default value for the
<TT><STRONG>flag</STRONG></TT> parameter is 1.
If <TT><STRONG>curl</STRONG></TT> is not specified, the vorticity can be
computed within Streakline, but at a considerable cost in time.
In this case the default value for <TT><STRONG>flag</STRONG></TT> is 0, and
if you want Streakline to compute the curl of the field, you must
set <TT><STRONG>flag</STRONG></TT> to 1.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B><TT><STRONG>stepscale</STRONG></TT>
</B></TD><TD><P>specifies the accuracy of the interpolation.
Streakline traces the path of a particle through the vector field in
discrete steps.
These steps are determined by interpolating vectors from the prior and
subsequent vector fields at the geometric position of the current
end of the streakline, and then linearly interpolating between
the results to produce a vector for the current position
and time.
A segment is then appended to the current streakline, which continues
it in the direction of the resulting vector.
<P>
The length of the new segment is determined by two factors.
First, the length of the projection of the segment along the edges of the
cells of the prior and subsequent vector fields in which the starting
point of the segment is found does not exceed a proportion (specified
by the <TT><STRONG>stepscale</STRONG></TT> parameter) of the length
of the edge.
Second, if grid is irregular, the segment is truncated at the boundary
of the element in which it begins.
This allows the segment length to be determined anew for the next
element.
<P>
Thus the <TT><STRONG>stepscale</STRONG></TT> parameter offers the user control
over the accuracy of the streakline.
If <TT><STRONG>stepscale</STRONG></TT> is a small value (perhaps in the range
of 0.01 to 0.05), the resulting streakline contains a relatively
large number of segments that closely trace small variations
in the vector field.
If <TT><STRONG>stepscale</STRONG></TT> is assigned a large number (0.5 to 1),
the steps are larger and less accurate, but require less execution
time.
Note, however, that since the step is determined as a proportion of the
size of the grid cell in which it is contained, the segments are

small in areas in which the grid elements are small, and
proportionally larger in areas in which the grid
elements are large.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Streaklines trace particles through time.
Associated with the
<A NAME="IDX727"></A>
streakline is a "time" component that indicates, for each position
of the streakline, the time at which the particle reached that
position.
The initial value in this component, therefore, is equal to the
starting time for that streak, which is by default the first
series position, or settable by the user using the
<TT><STRONG>time</STRONG></TT> parameter.
The final value in the time component is equal to the time at which
the particle exits from the vector field, either geometrically
or for one of the following reasons:
<UL>
<P><LI>It has reached the time associated with the final member of the
vector field series.
<P><LI>It has reached the time associated with the current frame.
<P><LI>It has reached the time associated with the series member indicated
by the <TT><STRONG>head</STRONG></TT> parameter.
</UL>
<P>
The output streaklines also contain a "data" component that
indicates the velocity of the data field at each position
along the streakline.
