1. License: ISC remains the exclusive owner of the Program and the
Documentation. ICS grant to Customer a nonexclusive, nontransferable
(except as provided herein) license to use, modify, have modified, and
prepare and have prepared derivative works of the Program as
necessary to use it.
<P>
2. Customer Rights: Customer may use, modify and have modified and prepare
and have prepared derivative works of the Program in object code form
as is necessary to use the Program. Customer may make copies of the
Program up to the number authorized by ICS in writing, in advance. There
shall be no fee for Statically linked copies of the Motif libraries.
Statically linked copies are object code copies integrated within a
single application program and executable only with that single
application. Run Time copies require payment of ICS' then applicable
fee. Run Time copies are copies which include any portion of a linkable
object file (&quot;.o&quot; file), library file
(&quot;.a&quot; file), the window manager
(mwm manager), the U.I.L. compiler, a shared library, or any tool or
mechanism that enables generation of any portion of such components;
other copies will require payment of ICS' applicable fees. TRANSFERS
TO THIRD PARTIES OF COPIES OF THE LICENSED PROGRAMS, OR OF APPLICATIONS
PROGRAMS INCORPORATING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY PORTION THEREOF), REQUIRE
ICS' RESELLER AGREEMENT. Customer may not lease or lend the Program to
any party. Customer shall not attempt to reverse engineer, disassemble
or decompile the program.
<P>
3. Limited Warranty: (a) ICS warrants that for thirty (30) days from the
delivery to Customer, each copy of the Program, when installed and used
in accordance with the Documentation, will conform in all material
respects to the description of the Program's operations in the
Documentation. (b) Customer's exclusive remedy and ICS' sole liability
under this warranty shall be for ICS to attempt, through reasonable
efforts, to correct any material failure of the Program to perform as
warranted, if such failure is reported to ICS within the warranty period
and Customer, at ICS' request, provides ICS with sufficient information
(which may include access to Customer's computer system for use of
Customer's copies of the Program by ICS personnel) to reproduce the
defect in question; provided, that if ICS is unable to correct any such
failure within a reasonable time, ICS may, at its sole option, refund to
the Customer the license fee paid for the Product. (c) ICS need not treat
minor discrepancies in the Documentation as errors in the Program, and
may instead furnish correction to the Program. (d) ICS does not warrant
that the operation of the Program will be uninterrupted or error-free,
or that all errors will be corrected. (e) THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS IN
LIEU OF, AND ICS DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ICS BE LIABLE FOR
ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
LOST PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM OR
DOCUMENTATION.
<P>
4. Term and Termination: The term of this agreement shall be
indefinite; however, this Agreement may be terminated by ICS in the event
of a material default by Customer which is not cured within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of notice of such breech by ICS. Customer may
terminate this Agreement at any time by destruction of the Program, the
Documentation, and all other copies of either of them. Upon termination,
Customer shall immediately cease use of, and return immediately to ICS,
all existing copies of the Program and Documentation, and cease all use
thereof. All provisions hereof regarding liability and limits thereon
shall survive the termination of this the Agreement.

as that term is defined in Clause 252.227-7013(c)(1) of the DFARS and
(ii) if the software is supplied to any unit or agency of the
