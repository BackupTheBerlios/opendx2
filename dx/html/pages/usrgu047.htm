<P>
Data Explorer provides you with the capability to distribute your visual program
across a
network of heterogeneous workstations.
Distributing your visual program provides you with parallelism and
enhanced resource utilization.
Parallelism is achieved by the simultaneous execution of different
portions of the visual program on each of the workstations.
The amount of parallelism that you can achieve is dependent on the
organization of your visual program and the number of available
workstations.
<P>
Enhanced resource utilization can be achieved, for example, by
assigning computationally intensive portions of the visual
program to the more powerful workstations.
If the data you are visualizing is located on one or more workstations,
then performing some of the data realization and transformation on
the workstations containing the data can reduce data transfer
overheads.
<P>
Distributed processing in Data Explorer is achieved in two ways:
by using "outboard" modules (user supplied) or by placing groups
of tools to "execution groups".
These two methods can be used independently or in combination.
For a discussion of outboard modules see <A HREF="progu039.htm#HDRMODSIOR">11.3
, "Inboard, Outboard, and Runtime-loadable Modules"</A> in <I>IBM Visualization
Data Explorer Programmer&#39;s Reference</I>.
Execution groups can be created and modified using the Visual Program
Editor or by using attributes if you are using the Data Explorer scripting
language (see <A HREF="usrgu050.htm#HDRUSL">Chapter 10. "Data Explorer Scripting
Language"</A>).
Once the execution groups are created, you assign each group to the
workstations over which you wish to distribute the visual
program.
You can assign more than one group per workstation.
Note that if more than one group is assigned to a given workstation,
the groups will not be run as separate processes.
<P>
Data Explorer uses this two part approach of creating groups and assigning
groups to make it easier for you to change the set of
workstations over which you distribute your
visual programs.
This utility is especially convenient if you share visual programs
with other users.
<P>
When you execute a visual program for the first time, the Data Explorer
executive is started on each workstation over which
the program is to be distributed.
Each executive "plans" the execution and executes each of the
execution groups assigned to it.
This means that not only is the computation and data flow distributed,
but the control flow is distributed as well.
One of the workstations is a "master"--the workstation to
which the user interface is connected.
The master creates and initiates the communication between the other
workstations and distributes commands from the user interface
to all the workstations.
The master also executes any execution group that is not assigned
to another workstation in addition to its own
assigned groups.

By default, all tools in a visual program belong to a single unnamed
execution group.
This group is executed on the master workstation.
New execution groups are created and existing execution groups are
modified and deleted using the <TT><STRONG>Execution Group</STRONG></TT>
dialog box (<A HREF="#FIGPG1">Figure 79</A>).
<P>
The dialog box consist of three parts&#58;

Once you have decomposed your visual program into execution groups, you
can assign these groups to workstations (or hosts).
If you do not specify a host for a particular execution group, the group
will be executed on the master.
Execution groups are assigned to a host using the <TT><STRONG>Execution
Group
Assignment...</STRONG></TT> dialog box (<A HREF="#FIGPG2">Figure 80</A>).
<P>
The dialog box consists of three parts&#58;
<TABLE CELLPADDING="3">

To assign an execution group to a workstation:
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>Open the <TT><STRONG>Execution Group Assignment...</STRONG></TT>
dialog box by
selecting the <TT><STRONG>Connection</STRONG></TT> menu <TT><STRONG>Execution

and hit
Enter.
<LI>Click on the <TT><STRONG>Options...</STRONG></TT> button to specify any
options     for the
host, for example memory size.
<LI>If there are more groups to assign to hosts repeat Steps 2 through
4, otherwise, click on <TT><STRONG>OK</STRONG></TT>.
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_303" HREF="#PToC_303">Restrictions</A></H3>
<P>
In general, you can place any tool in any execution group, alter the
members of an execution group at any time, or change the
assignment of an execution group from one host to
another at any time.
The exceptions to these rules deal with:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Modules maintaining state (e.g., Streakline)
<LI>Hardware rendering
<LI>The Pick Module.
</UL>
<P>
Modules that maintain internal state information using private cache
objects cannot be freely moved between hosts.
Doing so will cause the module to lose its state information or obtain
old state information.
If you do reassign a module maintaining state to another host, you
should reset the server using the <TT><STRONG>Connection</STRONG></TT> menu
<TT><STRONG>Reset Server</STRONG></TT> option to ensure correct execution.
The only Data Explorer module provided with the system that maintains state
information is Streakline.
<P>
When you are using the hardware rendering option with either the
Display or Image tools, the tool should be assigned to
execution on the host physically connected to your
display.
<P>
The Pick module must be run on the same host as the Image tool.
