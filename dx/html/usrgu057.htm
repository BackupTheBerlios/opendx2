<H2><A NAME="HDRSEM" HREF="usrgu050.htm#PToC_355">10.8 Understanding the Script
Execution Model</A></H2>
<P>
An execution model is applied to the constructs defined by the Data Explorer
scripting language.
This model consists of the environment structure that is maintained
during function calls, the behavior associated with macro
expansions, the scope rules used for locating the value
associated with a variable, and the semantics
associated with assignment statements and
function calls.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_356" HREF="usrgu050.htm#PToC_356">Top-level
Environment</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX927"></A>
<P>
All <I>global</I> assignment statements and <I>initial</I>
function invocations occur in the top-level environment.
This environment is special in that all assignment statements and
function invocations initiated in this environment are always
executed.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_357" HREF="usrgu050.htm#PToC_357">Function
Execution</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX928"></A>
<P>
When either a macro or a module function is executed, a new dynamically
scoped environment specific to that function call is created.
Variables that correspond to the function&#39;s input and output formal
parameters are created in this new environment.
The variables corresponding to the output formal parameters are
initialized to <TT><STRONG>NULL</STRONG></TT>.
Those variables corresponding to the input formal parameters are
initialized in the manner described in the preceding section.
If an input and an output formal parameter both have the same name, then
they share a single parameter and are initialized to the value passed
as input when the function is called.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_358" HREF="usrgu050.htm#PToC_358">Macro Expansion</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX929"></A>
<A NAME="IDX930"></A>
<P>
When the function being called is a macro, the macro is effectively
expanded in-line after first constructing the necessary
environment for its input and output parameters.
This guarantees that the partial orderings defined by macros are
maintained.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRVUIM" HREF="usrgu050.htm#PToC_359">Variables Used in
Macros</A></H3>
<P>
The Data Explorer allows you to use variables on both the left and right sides
of a function assignment; that is, as both left-side and right-side.
<A NAME="IDX931"></A>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRVALSV">Variables as Left-Side Values</A></H4>
<P>
All assignments in a macro&#39;s environment affect variables that are
local to the macro.
These variables, if they do not already exist, are created in the
macro&#39;s environment when they are first used on the
left-hand side of an assignment expression.
Thus, a variable outside of a macro cannot be modified with that macro.
<P>
The only way to make such a change is to propagate a new value out of
the macro using its output formal parameters, and to use this
returned value in an assignment statement in the
enclosing environment.
<P>
Given these semantics, it is possible for a local version of a variable
to come into existence and obscure a more global version of a
variable, midway through a macro&#39;s execution.
<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRVARSV">Variables as Right-Side Values</A></H4>
<P>
The values of variables used in a macro in expressions and as function
arguments are found according to standard dynamic scoping
rules.
If the variable exists in the macro&#39;s local environment, then its
value is used.
Otherwise, the enclosing environments, all the way to the top-level
environment, are searched to locate the variable.
The value used is the value associated with the first instance of the
variable.
If the variable is not found in any environment, then the value
<TT><STRONG>NULL</STRONG></TT> is used.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_362">Example</A></H4>
<P>
The following is a sample script that illustrates how variables
are treated in macros:
<PRE>
// This is a complete sample script
macro add(a, b) -&gt; (sum)
{

c = a + b;    // c is created and given the value a+b
c = a + x;    // x is found in the top level, and used in this expression
c = a + z;    // z does not exist anywhere; NULL is used
sum = a + b;  // sum is created local to the macro, separate from the
              //     version of sum in the top level
}
x = 7;
sum = 10;
total = add(4, 4);  // total = 8, sum stays at 10
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_363" HREF="usrgu050.htm#PToC_363">Assignment and Function
Call Semantics</A></H3>
<P>
As stated earlier, all assignment statements and function calls
initiated at the top-level environment are executed.
In a macro, the process is slightly different.
When a macro is expanded, its statements are first analyzed to
determine whether they need to be executed.
The rule of thumb for determining if a statement will be executed is
that it must contribute, either directly or indirectly, to:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>One of the values passed into a module that has a side effect
<LI>A value assigned to a top-level variable, using a macro&#39;s
formal output parameters.
</UL>
<P>
There are two kinds of "side effect" modules:
<UL>
<P><LI>Those that do not produce any Object outputs.
Display and WriteImage are examples of this kind of module because
they modify things such as monitors and files, which are outside
of the language&#39;s domain and control.
This type of module is represented in the graphical user interface
as having no output tabs.
<P><LI>Those that make use of internal executive features.
These modules are specially marked in their <TT>.mdf</TT> (module
description) files as ones that can cause side effects.
</UL>
Side effect modules are always executed.
(For information on the SIDE_EFFECT flag, see <A
HREF="progu037.htm#HDRMDFSEC">11.1 , "Module Description Files"</A>
in <I>IBM Visualization Data Explorer Programmer&#39;s Reference</I>.)
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_364" HREF="usrgu050.htm#PToC_364">Execution Example</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX932"></A>
<P>
The macro <TT><STRONG>sum3</STRONG></TT> in the following example computes
both the sum of its first two arguments and the sum of all three
of its arguments.
When the top-level assignment statement on line 7 is executed, the
statements in lines 3 and 4 are both executed, resulting in
the values 11 and 111 being assigned to the top-level
variables <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR> respectively.
When the top-level assignment statement on line 8 is executed, only
the statement on line 3 is executed.
Since the value in the output variable <VAR>e</VAR> is not assigned to
anything in the calling environment, the statement on line 4 need
not be executed.
<P>
<PRE>
macro sum3 (a, b, c) -&gt; (d, e)                 // 1
{                                               // 2
    d = a + b;                                  // 3
    e = d + c;                                  // 4
}                                               // 5
                                                // 6
x, y = sum3 (1, 10, 100);                       // 7
x    = sum3 (1, 10, 100);                       // 8
