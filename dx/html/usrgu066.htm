<P>
CDF is a data abstraction for self-describing multidimensional
Arrays.
It represents a simpler data model than that of Data Explorer, one similar to
that of the Array Object.
Data are accessed in CDF through an applications programming interface,
available as C and FORTRAN libraries from the National Space Science
Data Center, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.
Data in CDF may be stored in a number of physical formats
(e.g., native or portable binary, single or multiple files, row or
column majority), but the interface is the same.
Hence, data in a CDF written in a format "foreign" to the
workstation on which Data Explorer is running are converted
automatically during the Import process.
<P>
Data Explorer provides support for importing Fields stored as CDF
r-variables.
To import data from a CDF, specify the CDF name as the
<TT><STRONG>name</STRONG></TT>
parameter in the Import Configuration dialog box (not the file
name, since the CDF may be in multiple-file format).
If the CDF has more than one variable, which is typical, Data Explorer
categorizes each variable as positions, series, or data
as appropriate.
Variables that vary in one dimension only and are not record-variant
are considered positions, and become the positions component in
a Field Object.
In many cases, these variables may have the CDF variable mnemonics
of LATITUDE and LONGITUD, which are mapped to the first (x) and
second (y) components of the positions vector, if they exist.
This mapping permits direct use of these data with cartographic and
other tools for the earth and space sciences that are publicly
available for use with Data Explorer.
Otherwise, the first <I>n</I> variables categorized as positions
(where <I>n</I> is the dimensionality of the CDF dimensions)
are used to form the positions component.
Any additional such variables are treated as data
variables.
If there are no positions-type variables, the positions component will
be a regular grid with origin of 0 and increments of 1 in each
axis, where the number of axes corresponds to the
dimensionality of the imported CDF r-variable.
<P>
If there are records in the CDF, each record is imported as a
series member.
In many cases there is a variable with the mnemonic EPOCH, which
corresponds to a time stamp for each record in the CDF.
If so, the double representing msec since 0 AD in each value of EPOCH
is stored as the series position attribute.
If not, the first variable that is record-variant and
nondimensional-variant is considered the
series variable.
This variable is imported as the series position attribute.
If there is no time variable, the series position starts at 1 and
increments by 1 per series member, so that there is one
member for each record in the CDF.
The series position attribute, containing the time stamp, may be
accessed with the  Attribute module.
<P>
You can specify the name or names of the data variable in the
<I>variable</I>
parameter of the Import tool and the corresponding variable(s) will be
imported.
In the same way, you can use <I>start</I>, <I>end</I>, and
<I>delta</I> to import a subset of CDF records.
<P>
Variable and global attributes present in the CDF are imported as Object
attributes.
These attributes may be accessed through the Attribute and Inquire
modules (e.g., to build metadata-driven applications).
<P>
Variables that vary in all dimensions and are record-variant are
considered data variables.
Any variable that is not a position or time variable is also considered
a data variable, allowing every variable to be imported.
If you want the positions to be a variable other than the one chosen by
Data Explorer, you can use Replace or Rename to switch the components (e.g.,
two or more sets of positions information are stored for
different coordinate systems).
Each data variable becomes a data component in a Field
Object.
Hence, there is one Field for each data variable in the Group
imported.
Since Data Explorer can handle data more flexibly than CDF, some assumptions
are imposed upon certain classes of data that may be imported:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Since data stored in CDF are not distinguished as cell-centered or
node-based, all data components are treated as the latter,
(i.e., data dep positions).
The Post module may be used to transform a Field to cell-centered
(i.e., data dep connections).
<LI> Since CDF does not "natively" support Fields other than
rank=0, all data variables are treated as scalars.
The Compute module can be used to construct the appropriate vector
representation from multiple scalar Fields.
<LI>The connections component depends on the dimensionality of the
data variable such that 0 = none, 1 = lines, 2 = quads,
3 = cubes, and so on.
<LI>Each positions variable is considered a term of a Product Array
to form the positions component.
<LI>All variables of 0 dimension are imported as the data component of
a Field with no positions and no connections.
If the LATITUDE and/or LONGITUD variables exist, the other variables
are considered data components of Fields with positions and no
connections, where the positions are those latitude and
longitude variables.
You can construct an appropriate Field with positions and connections
from the variables that are imported through modules like
Construct, Regrid, and Connect.
<LI>All variables of 1 dimension are imported as the data component of
a Field of lines, where the positions would typically be a scalar
(i.e., the one independent variable).
If the LATITUDE and LONGITUD variables exist, then the positions are a
2-vector constructed from the latitude and longitude Arrays, but
still a line.
<P>
One-dimensional variables in CDF may be of one of three distinct
classes, which are NOT distinguished in the way they are
stored in a CDF file:
1) true 1-dimensional or line data; 2) indexed point data;
or 3) indexed mesh data.
You must know which class the variable belongs to in order to ensure
that Data Explorer processes the data in an appropriate fashion.
The first class is handled correctly.
For the second and third class, the connections component of any
imported Field(s) may be meaningless.
You can use the Remove module to eliminate it and treat the Field as
scattered or point data (i.e., use Regrid or Connect to create
a more appropriate mesh).
<P>
Treating such data as a collection of points is consistent with the
original design philosophy of CDF and CDF applications.
The third case actually represents an irregular mesh, which Data Explorer
can support directly.
Unfortunately, the connectivity information (i.e., the mesh structure)
is typically not stored in the CDF, so Import cannot directly
reconstruct the original mesh.
Hence, the data must be treated as point data unless you have
information, external to the CDF, that can be used to
recreate the original mesh structure.
