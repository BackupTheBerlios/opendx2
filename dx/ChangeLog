4.1.0
===============

With this revision, a lot of the Gnu AutoConf stuff was cleaned up to help improve building the package from the source code.

Many updates to the AutoConf build routines for JavaDX. JavaDX should now build readily on all systems.

Added new configuration options to disable building some libraries and JavaDX. Added options to direct where java files reside if they can't be found:
--disable-buildlibdx
--disable-installhtml
--without-javadx (remove compilation alltogether)
--with-jni-path=/PathToDirectoryContaining-jni.h:/PathToDirectoryContaining-jni_md.h
--with-cosmojar-path=/PathToCosmoJarFile/cosmoFileName.jar
--with-java40jar-path=/PathToJava40JarFile/java40.jar

The internal copyright mechanisms all get updated from the configure scripts this makes tracking versions from the user interface easier.

Some general source code clean-up was done, there will be much more to come in the next set of revisions.

OpenDX-generated makefiles are now largely platform independent as created.
To the extent that they have platform dependencies, these are (or should be)
determined by dx configure and written into arch.mak. This allows the module builder to generate makefiles compatible with OpenDX, such that runtime loadables work on a number of platforms and dxui now writes compatible makefiles for building and installing JX applets.

Problems with Interactors not working properly on some systems is fixed.

Linux binaries can now use loadable modules.

dx script is now stored in two locations during installation in case the installation is moved and /usr/bin/dx is forgotten to be collected.

name change of dx.workerscript to dxworker

defaulting of the environment variable of DXMACROS, DXDATA, and DXROOT if they are not set.

added -whereami option to dx to detect location of dx install

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not overwritten on Solaris but just added to now.

mdf2c is now constructed with appropriate open source paths.

Help files links and install should now be correct after installation.

Added support for 15 bit and 32 bit color displays.

Added outboard.c to source tree to be included with outboard modules.

Added support for including libraries from ImageMagick build into libDX.a. If the libraries are shared, then they are not added and must be linked at a later time.

Forced Linux versions to run as single processor only not SMP until shared memory is correctly addressed.

Fixed a memory leak where if DXMACROS was set, it would tromp on memory. This is now fixed and relieves many core dumps in the exec.

Removal of some hard coded geometries on dialog boxes to make dialogs work better with Lesstif. So far no reports of any problems with Motif.

Added support for using ImageMagick. If ImageMagick is available during compilation, then many more image export formats will be available by choosing the ImageMagick formats.

Correction to AutoRegrid module. "infinity" used as the radius caused a core dump. This did not show up with all compilers.

Fix in Colorbar to make positions "dep positions". Fixes compliance with some other tools.

Fix in the Enumerate module for properly creating counts.

A few minor fixes with the import routines for HDF and netCDF.

Corrected typos in module SimplifySurface.

Correction in Stack module for series data.

libDX is now being built correctly so modules can be linked to it with proper functionality.

Added functionality for dx to use its default memory rules on linux. Fix for possible negative memory request.

Correction to quads for possible loop when point coincides with vertex.

Correction when a point is on the line containing an edge. Need to check sign.

Fixes to allow FreeBSD to compile correctly.

A correction the Grid Dialog box. Some testing may still be in order.

A error with postscript printing the networks was corrected.

Correction in the Browser for a pointer to an array.

Clean up a lot of the Motif function calls prototype mismatches.


4.0.6
=============
First initial stable release.


4.0.3
=============
Added code to makefiles and c files to create libDX, libDXlite, libcallm

Fixed missing splat in WorkspaceW.c

Removed apparently unnecessary code referring to _XmDestroyParentCallback

Changed configure to look for old versions of Lesstif and set OLD_LESSTIF, 
rather than any version of Lesstif and set USING_LESSTIF

HP_UX -> HP-UX

More general test for cygwin

install change - mkdir dx/bin rather than use INSTALL

configure test for sys/select and use in PacketIF.C
